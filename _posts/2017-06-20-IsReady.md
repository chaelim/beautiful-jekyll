While back, I found something like following code from production and quite a bit surprised. `IsReady` or `IsDirty` function is very frequently called from main thread which enters a lock to check a shared boolean value. Yes, it was before C++11 and we didn't have common framework for async task scheduling. Quick fix was just removing lock for `m_isReady` and added `volatile` specifier. However, [`volatile`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_%28computer_programming%29)) is not really synchronization primitive. Moreover, Visual Studio had different behavior in different versions back then.

```
// IsDirty called from main thread frequently.
bool Foo::IsDirty()
{
    ScopedLock(m_aLock);
    return m_isReady;
}

void Foo::Process()
{
    ScopedLock(m_aLock);
   
    // Do expensive work here. 
    
    // Write result to shared variable.
    
    m_isReady = true;
}
```
