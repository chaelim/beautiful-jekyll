Today is the last day of year 2016 or new year's eve 2017. I'm officially starting my blog here just before 2016 is gone forever. It's something I've been trying to do many years ago. 

During the [Year 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016), many unexpected political events happened all over the world. That makes me feel new year 2017 will be a great year of debugging and crash analysis. :)

I have a list of things I'd like to post soon. Please stay tuned and [Subscribe to my feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml).

Happy new year to everyone!
