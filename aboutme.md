My name is C.S. Lim and this is my blog; Iâ€™m a lifelong programmer. I learned programming in 1983 with an 8-bit [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) machine. [MSX BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX_BASIC) was my first programming language. I loved to hack games on MSX through binary hex editing raw machine code.

### my projects
- Coauthored couple of programming and computer books in Korean with my friends back in early 1990 while I was college student.
- Implemented Korean [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) for Windows XP/Vista and developed several other Korean language features.
- In 2003, I joined to a company called [ArenaNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArenaNet) to release [Guild Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars). It was a small unknown game studio at that time founded by three former game industry veterans from Blizzard. I worked directly with people like [Patrick Wyatt](http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/). I learned a lot about online game servers and networking.
- More recently, I was Performance Architect in ArenanNet for [Guild Wars 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars_2). I found some interesting performance issues in Guild Wars2 and fixed it.
- I also helped a startup company named [Motiga](https://www.motiga.com/) for a while and built backend servers for [Gigantic](https://www.gogigantic.com/en/) game.
- Currently working for Microsoft as Programmer.
