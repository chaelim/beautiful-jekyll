subtitle: I’m a lifelong developer and I roast my coffee.
---

My name is C.S. Lim; I’m a lifelong programmer. I learned programming in 1983 for the first time with an 8-bit [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) machine. [MSX BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX_BASIC) was my first programming language.

### history
- I loved to hack games on MSX through binary hex editing raw machine code.
- Started my professional carreer in Microsoft Korea. I implemented Korean [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) for Windows XP and developed several other things over there.
- One of big changes in my life, in 2003, I moved to United State and joined to a company called [ArenanNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArenaNet) to release [GuildWars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars). It was unknown game studio at that time founded by three former game industry veterans from Blizzard. I worked directly with people like [Patrick Wyatt](http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/). That's where I learned a lot about online game servers and networking.
- Beside building servers, I solved and debugged multi-threading issues. Performance improvement is also my favoriate task.
- I worked for a startup company named [Motiga](https://www.motiga.com/) for a while and built backend servers for [Gigantic](https://www.gogigantic.com/en/) game.
